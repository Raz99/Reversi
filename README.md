## Game Rules

### Objective
Finish the game with the highest number of discs in your color.

### Starting Position
- The game starts with 4 discs in the center of the board:
    - Player 1 (Blue) â€“ positions (3,3) and (4,4)
    - Player 2 (Red) â€“ positions (3,4) and (4,3)

### Disc Types

1. **â¬¤ Simple Disc**
    - Standard Reversi disc.
    - Flips according to standard rules.

2. **â­• Unflippable Disc**
    - Cannot be flipped after being placed.
    - Any opponent discs in the same line are flipped, but this disc remains.

3. **ðŸ’£ Bomb Disc**
    - When flipped, all adjacent discs (including diagonals) are flipped.
    - May trigger chain reactions with other bomb discs.
    - Cannot flip an **Unflippable Disc**.

---

### Game Flow

- Players take turns placing a disc of their color on an empty square.
- The move must flip at least one opponent disc.
- Discs are flipped if they lie in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) between the new disc and another disc of the current player's color.
- The game ends when no legal moves are available for either player.
- The player with the most discs wins.

---

### Undo & Reset

- **Undo**:
    - Available only in a 2-human-player game (no AI).
    - Can undo multiple moves back to the initial position.
- **Reset**:
    - Restarts the game while keeping the win counters.

---

## AI Players

- **RandomAI** â€“ Chooses a random legal move.
- **GreedyAI** â€“ Chooses the move that flips the most opponent discs.  
  Tie-breaking: rightmost position, then bottommost.

---

## GUI

The game uses a provided **ReversiGUI** framework:
- Displays the board and discs.
- Allows placing discs by clicking on squares.
- Shows messages for moves, flips, undos, and the winner.
